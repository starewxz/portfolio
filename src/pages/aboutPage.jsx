                        Iâ€™m a 16-year-old passionate full-stack web developer from Ukraine. I began programming in the spring of 2024, after deciding to leave behind my football career.
                        Fun fact â€” before I got into coding, I had almost no experience with computers.
                        I wasnâ€™t into gaming, and when I did play, it wasnâ€™t even on a PC. So diving into programming truly felt like stepping into an entirely new world.

                    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        My journey started with free YouTube tutorials, and as my passion grew, I began investing in quality courses on Udemy.
                        After about a year of consistent learning, Iâ€™m proud of how far Iâ€™ve come â€” from building a simple {" "}

                        as my first project to developing full-featured, real-world applications showcased in my portfolio.

                    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">

                        â€” a project I designed and developed entirely on my own. Over time, Iâ€™ve also connected with other developers and mentors, whose support continues to help me grow and stay motivated.

                        But this path hasnâ€™t always been easy. Like many self-taught learners, Iâ€™ve gone through periods of self-doubt, burnout, and mental blocks.
                        Some topics â€” especially parts of JavaScript or backend logic â€” were incredibly challenging at first. There were moments I felt stuck, even afraid to start something new or take on more serious, commercial projects. {" "}

                        Beyond coding, Iâ€™m passionate about sports and staying active. I train in boxing and enjoy spending time outdoors, whether it&apos;s playing volleyball, football, or just being with friends.
                        Staying physically active helps me stay mentally balanced and recharged for every new challenge.
