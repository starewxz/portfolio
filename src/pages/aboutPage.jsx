                        Iâ€™m a 16-year-old passionate full-stack web developer from Ukraine. I began programming in the spring of 2024, after deciding to quit playing football.
                        Fun fact: before I started coding, I had very little experience with computers. I didnâ€™t play many video games, and when I did, it wasnâ€™t on a PC.
                        So, beginning my programming journey felt like a completely new adventure.

                    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                        I started with free courses on YouTube and, as I got more serious, I invested in quality courses on Udemy.
                        After about a year of dedicated learning, Iâ€™m proud of the progress Iâ€™ve made. Just a year ago, my first project was a simple{" "}

                        Outside of programming, Iâ€™m very passionate about sports and active vacations. I train in boxing regularly, and during holidays, I love playing volleyball or football with friends.
                        Staying active keeps me balanced and energized for all my projects.
