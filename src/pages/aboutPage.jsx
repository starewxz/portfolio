                        Iâ€™m a 16-year-old passionate full-stack web developer from Ukraine.
                        I began programming in the spring of 2024, after deciding to quit
                        playing football. Fun fact: before I started coding, I had very
                        little experience with computers. I didnâ€™t play many video games,
                        and when I did, it wasnâ€™t on a PC. So, beginning my programming
                        journey felt like a completely new adventure.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I started with free courses on YouTube and, as I got more serious,
                        I invested in quality courses on Udemy. After about a year of
                        dedicated learning, Iâ€™m proud of the progress Iâ€™ve made. Just a year
                        ago, my first project was a simple
                        <a className={"cursor-pointer fancy-link ml-2 mr-2"} onClick={() => navigate("/projects/projectDetails/timer")}>
                        timer for Rubikâ€™s Cube
                        </a>
                        â€” nothing
                        like the portfolio Iâ€™ve built today.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        My first big project was creating a landing site for my brotherâ€™s
                        online
                        <a className={"cursor-pointer fancy-link ml-2 mr-2"} onClick={() => navigate("/projects/projectDetails/fluffy-steps")}>
                            slippers store
                        </a>
                        , which you can also check out on the projects
                        page. Over time, Iâ€™ve connected with many programmer friends, which
                        helps me grow and stay motivated.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Outside of programming, Iâ€™m very passionate about sports and active
                        vacations. I train in boxing regularly, and during holidays, I
                        love playing volleyball or football with friends. Staying active
                        keeps me balanced and energized for all my projects.
